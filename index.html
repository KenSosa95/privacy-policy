        <p class="text">
            At Eapp (accessible via <a href="https://www.eapp-services.com">https://www.eapp-services.com</a>), we are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This document outlines our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, explaining how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your data when you use our mobile application and services. By using our app, you agree to the terms outlined in this document.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text">
            Eapp serves solely as an intermediary platform connecting service providers with clients seeking their services. We facilitate by publicizing service listings, enabling clients to discover available offerings, and providing tools for managing reservations. However, Eapp does not offer or perform any of the listed services directly and is not responsible for the quality, safety, legality, or accuracy of the services provided by third-party service providers or for any actions or behaviors of clients.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Terms of Service</h2>

        <h2 class="section-title">2. Responsibilities of Service Providers and Clients</h2>
        <p class="bold">Service Providers:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Each service provider using Eapp must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and licensing requirements relevant to the services they offer, including, but not limited to, tax obligations, business licenses, health and safety regulations, and employment laws. Service providers are solely responsible for accurately declaring their earnings, meeting their legal and financial obligations, and reporting their earnings to tax authorities as required by law.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Clients:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Clients are responsible for ensuring they understand the terms of the services they are booking and should review details provided by service providers carefully before proceeding with any bookings. Clients should also communicate clearly with service providers to avoid misunderstandings regarding service details, timing, and costs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">3. Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
        <p class="bold">Eapp's Role:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Eapp does not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any services offered through the app. All transactions, agreements, and communications are solely between the client and the service provider.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Service Quality and Safety:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Eapp is not liable for any issues, disputes, or dissatisfaction arising from the services provided by service providers, including poor service quality, safety concerns, or misrepresentation.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Disputes and Misconduct:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Any disputes, claims, or incidents arising between clients and service providers must be resolved directly between the parties. Eapp may, at its discretion, provide limited assistance to facilitate communication between parties but is under no obligation to mediate, intervene, or resolve disputes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">4. Legal Compliance and Transparency</h2>
        <p class="bold">Ethical Use:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Eapp encourages transparency and legal compliance by all users of the app. Both service providers and clients agree to use the app ethically, lawfully, and responsibly.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Verification Measures:</p>
        <p class="text">
            While Eapp may implement verification measures to promote compliance, it cannot and does not guarantee that all users are legally compliant, qualified, or appropriately certified to provide the listed services. It is ultimately the responsibility of the client to verify the qualifications and reputation of the service provider.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">5. Payment and Financial Security</h2>
        <p class="bold">Payment Processing:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Eapp facilitates in-app payments through trusted third-party payment providers, ensuring transactions are handled securely. We do not store or process payment information directly, and all financial transactions are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective payment provider.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Payment Disputes:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Payment disputes or refunds for services should be addressed directly between the client and service provider. Eapp is not responsible for facilitating or mediating payment disputes, as these matters fall under the client-service provider agreement.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">6. Misuse and Violation of Terms</h2>
        <p class="bold">Account Suspension:</p>
        <p class="text">
            Eapp reserves the right to suspend or terminate the accounts of users who engage in fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activities on the app. Violations of Eapp's terms of use may result in account suspension, termination, or legal action.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Reporting Misconduct:</p>
        <p class="text">
            If a client or service provider suspects fraudulent, dangerous, or unethical behavior, they are encouraged to report it through the appropriate channels provided within the app.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">7. Updates to Terms and Compliance</h2>
        <p class="bold">Policy Amendments:</p>
